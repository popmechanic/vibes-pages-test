Christmas walrus with a wildcard/experimental lens... Let me think unconventionally here.

**OKLCH Colors for a festive but unexpected palette:**
- Deep ocean teal for the walrus: oklch(0.35 0.12 200)
- Warm Santa red: oklch(0.55 0.22 25)
- Icy white/cream: oklch(0.95 0.02 100)
- Golden tusks: oklch(0.75 0.15 85)
- Northern lights aurora greens/purples: oklch(0.6 0.2 160), oklch(0.5 0.18 300)
- Deep arctic night background: oklch(0.15 0.08 250)

**Gradients:**
- Aurora borealis effect for backgrounds
- Shimmering ice gradients

**The Walrus Character Concept:**
I'll create "Bartholomew Blubbersworth III" - a distinguished, monocle-wearing walrus aristocrat who runs a Christmas wish fulfillment service. Very unconventional take - he's not just cute, he's *eccentric*.

**App Functionality - Wildcard approach:**
Instead of a typical wish list, this is "Bartholomew's Wish Granting Bureau" - users submit wishes and Bartholomew (with his quirky responses) processes them. Each wish gets a unique status and Bartholomew's personal commentary. The walrus is drawn in SVG with a top hat AND Santa hat, monocle, and fancy mustache made from his whiskers.

**Immersive UI elements:**
- Floating snowflakes animation
- Aurora borealis background gradient
- Bartholomew speaks in a pompous Victorian style
- Wishes appear on fancy parchment-style cards
- Experimental: clicking Bartholomew makes him do silly things
