Theme: Christmas walrus with Santa hat - Wildcard/experimental lens

Let me think unconventionally here. Instead of a typical Christmas app, what if we create something bizarre and delightful - a "Walrus Wisdom Oracle" where a mystical Christmas walrus named "Blubbert Kringle" dispenses holiday fortunes and advice?

OKLCH Colors for this whimsical theme:
- Deep arctic night sky: oklch(0.15 0.08 260) - dark blue-purple
- Aurora borealis greens: oklch(0.6 0.2 160) - vibrant teal-green
- Warm Christmas gold: oklch(0.8 0.15 80) - festive gold
- Walrus brown: oklch(0.45 0.08 50) - warm brown
- Santa red: oklch(0.55 0.2 25) - rich red
- Icy white: oklch(0.95 0.02 220) - bluish white
- Magic purple: oklch(0.5 0.25 300) - mystical purple

Gradients:
- Northern lights effect with shifting colors
- Deep ocean to arctic sky

The walrus character "Blubbert Kringle" - I'll create an SVG walrus with:
- Big expressive eyes
- Magnificent tusks
- A jaunty Santa hat
- Maybe some mystical sparkles

App functionality - Wildcard style:
- Users ask the Christmas Walrus for holiday wisdom
- The walrus "contemplates" with animation
- Dispenses random festive fortunes/advice
- Users can save their favorite fortunes
- Each fortune has a "magic rating" (snowflakes)

Decorative elements:
- Floating snowflakes
- Aurora borealis shimmer effects
- Mystical stars and sparkles
- Ice crystals
