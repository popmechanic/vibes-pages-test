# Pitch

A Christmas walrus with a "Wildcard - unexpected, experimental, unconventional" lens... Let me think creatively here.

**Color Palette (OKLCH):**
- Deep arctic ocean blue: oklch(0.2 0.08 240) - base background
- Icy turquoise: oklch(0.7 0.15 190) - walrus highlights
- Warm Christmas red: oklch(0.5 0.2 25) - Santa hat, festive accents
- Golden tinsel: oklch(0.8 0.15 85) - sparkle effects
- Snow white: oklch(0.95 0.01 250) - text, snow
- Deep green: oklch(0.4 0.12 150) - holly, festive touches

**The Unconventional Twist:**
Instead of a typical Christmas app, this will be "Walrus Fortune Cookies" - a mystical walrus named "Bartholomew Tuskington III" who dispenses absurd, poetic Christmas fortunes. He's a philosophical arctic sage wearing a Santa hat, and users can ask him questions. The walrus will be rendered as creative ASCII/emoji art that animates.

**App Concept:**
- A fortune-telling walrus oracle
- Users submit questions or wishes
- Bartholomew delivers cryptic, whimsical Christmas wisdom
- Collection of past fortunes saved
- Surreal, dreamy arctic atmosphere with floating snowflakes

**Visual Elements:**
- Animated CSS snowfall
- Glowing aurora borealis gradient background
- The walrus as a detailed emoji/text art creation
- Mystical crystal ball vibes mixed with Christmas
- Floating ice platforms

**Walrus Character:**
"Bartholomew Tuskington III" - a distinguished, slightly pompous yet lovable walrus sage who speaks in riddles and holiday metaphors.
