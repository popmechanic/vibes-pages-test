Christmas-themed walrus with a wildcard/experimental lens - let me think unconventionally here.

**The Walrus Character:**
- Name: "Winslow the Wish-Granting Walrus" - a mystical Arctic oracle who grants Christmas wishes
- Personality: Ancient, wise, slightly chaotic, speaks in riddles, loves sardines as offerings

**Wildcard/Experimental Approach:**
- Instead of a typical wish list, this is a "Wish Oracle" where Winslow responds to wishes with cryptic, humorous predictions
- The walrus could be rendered as an ASCII art character that "animates" or changes expressions
- Glitchy, aurora borealis aesthetic mixed with classic Christmas
- Wishes appear as floating ice crystals

**OKLCH Colors:**
- Deep arctic night sky: oklch(0.15 0.08 260) - very dark blue
- Aurora green: oklch(0.7 0.2 150) - vibrant teal-green
- Aurora pink/magenta: oklch(0.65 0.25 330) - bright pink
- Ice blue: oklch(0.85 0.1 220) - pale icy blue
- Christmas red: oklch(0.55 0.22 25) - festive red for Santa hat
- Gold/star: oklch(0.8 0.18 90) - warm gold

**Gradients:**
- Background: aurora-like gradient shifting from deep blue to hints of green/pink
- Cards: frosted glass with ice blue gradients

**Visual Elements:**
- ASCII art walrus with Santa hat that changes expressions
- Floating snowflakes (❄️)
- Ice crystal wish cards
- Aurora borealis animated background effect
- Glitchy text effects for oracle responses

**App Functionality:**
- Submit a Christmas wish to Winslow
- Winslow "contemplates" (loading animation) then delivers a cryptic oracle response
- See all wishes floating as ice crystals
- Each wish gets a randomly generated mystical response

This is experimental because it's an oracle/fortune-teller mechanic rather than a simple list, with ASCII art and unconventional visual styling.
