Christmas walrus with a wildcard/experimental lens - let me think unconventionally here.

**OKLCH Colors:**
- Deep arctic ocean blue: oklch(0.15 0.08 240) - mysterious depths
- Glowing neon Christmas red: oklch(0.55 0.25 25) - electric festive
- Icy cyan aurora: oklch(0.7 0.15 200) - northern lights feel
- Warm gold star glow: oklch(0.85 0.18 85) - twinkling stars
- Snow white with blue tint: oklch(0.95 0.02 240)
- Deep walrus brown: oklch(0.35 0.08 50)

**Gradients:**
- Aurora borealis effect with multiple color stops
- Deep ocean to icy surface transitions

**Wildcard/Experimental approach:**
- The walrus named "Cornelius Tusksgiving McFlipperton III" - a philosophical walrus who dispenses holiday wisdom
- Interactive fortune-cookie style wisdom generator
- ASCII art walrus that "speaks" through speech bubbles
- Glitchy/retro-futuristic Christmas aesthetic
- The walrus runs a "Holiday Wish Granting Service" but with absurdist twists
- Users submit wishes, Cornelius provides cryptic but oddly profound responses

**App Concept:**
A wish-granting service run by Cornelius the Christmas Walrus. Users submit holiday wishes, and Cornelius responds with his unique brand of walrus wisdom. The aesthetic is glitchy aurora borealis meets retro terminal vibes.

**Visual elements:**
- ASCII art walrus with Santa hat
- Glowing neon text effects
- Scanline overlays
- Northern lights animated background feel
- Speech bubbles with typewriter effect feel
