# Pitch

Christmas-themed walrus app with a wildcard/experimental lens. Let me think unconventionally here...

**The Concept:** A fortune-telling walrus named "Winslow the Wise Walrus" who delivers cryptic Christmas prophecies and holiday wisdom. This is unexpected because instead of a typical Christmas list or countdown, it's a mystical oracle experience.

**OKLCH Colors:**
- Deep arctic ocean blue: oklch(0.15 0.08 240) - mysterious deep background
- Icy teal: oklch(0.6 0.15 200) - magical ice glow
- Festive red: oklch(0.55 0.2 25) - Santa hat and accents
- Golden prophecy glow: oklch(0.75 0.18 85) - mystical text highlights
- Aurora green: oklch(0.65 0.2 150) - northern lights accent
- Soft snow white: oklch(0.95 0.01 250) - text and snow

**Gradients:**
- Background: Deep arctic aurora gradient
- Cards: Icy mystical glass effect
- Prophecy reveal: Golden shimmer gradient

**Visual Elements:**
- ASCII art walrus with Santa hat (unconventional choice)
- Snowflakes using CSS animations
- Crystal ball/mystical orb aesthetic
- Northern lights shimmer effects

**App Functionality:**
- Users ask Winslow for Christmas prophecies/wisdom
- The walrus "meditates" with a loading animation
- Delivers cryptic, humorous holiday fortunes
- Save favorite prophecies
- Each prophecy gets stored in Fireproof

**Immersive UI:**
- Mysterious arctic cave atmosphere
- Twinkling stars/snow
- Dramatic prophecy reveal animations
- The walrus "speaks" with theatrical flair
