Christmas walrus with a wildcard/experimental lens - let's go unconventional!

**Colors (OKLCH):**
- Deep arctic ocean blue: oklch(0.25 0.08 240) - mysterious depths
- Icy teal: oklch(0.6 0.15 195) - glacial vibes
- Warm Christmas red: oklch(0.55 0.22 25) - Santa hat
- Festive gold: oklch(0.8 0.18 85) - ornamental
- Snow white: oklch(0.95 0.01 250) - crisp and clean
- Northern lights green: oklch(0.65 0.2 150) - aurora borealis accent

**Gradients:**
- Aurora borealis effect for background
- Icy water gradient for walrus habitat

**The Unconventional Twist:**
Instead of a typical app, let's make a "Walrus Wish Granter" - a fortune cookie meets magic 8-ball meets Christmas wish list. The walrus is named "Bartholomew Tuskington III" - a distinguished, monocle-wearing aristocratic walrus who grants festive wishes with theatrical flair.

**Visual Expression:**
- Creative SVG walrus with Santa hat, monocle, and distinguished mustache
- Floating snowflakes using CSS animations
- Northern lights background effect
- Walrus "speaks" wishes in fancy speech bubbles

**App Functionality:**
- Users submit Christmas wishes
- Bartholomew dramatically "considers" them with animation
- He grants/modifies wishes with whimsical responses
- Wish history with his verdicts

**Immersive Elements:**
- Animated aurora borealis background
- Floating snowflakes
- Walrus animations (tusks wiggling, monocle glinting)
- Typewriter effect for Bartholomew's responses
