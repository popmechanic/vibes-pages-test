# Pitch

Christmas-themed walrus with a wildcard/experimental lens... Let me think unconventionally here.

**Colors (OKLCH):**
- Deep arctic night blue: oklch(0.15 0.08 250) - the frozen ocean at night
- Festive red: oklch(0.5 0.2 25) - Santa hat and decorations
- Icy turquoise: oklch(0.7 0.15 195) - glacial ice highlights
- Golden twinkle: oklch(0.85 0.15 85) - Christmas lights
- Snow white: oklch(0.95 0.02 250) - snow and tusks

**Gradients:**
- Arctic aurora gradient for backgrounds
- Icy shimmer effects

**The Walrus Character:**
I'll create "Bartholomew Tuskington III" - a sophisticated, slightly absurdist walrus who runs a Christmas wish-granting service. He's wearing a Santa hat, monocle, and has a distinguished mustache made of icicles.

**Experimental/Wildcard Elements:**
- The walrus speaks in formal Victorian English
- Wishes are "processed" through a whimsical animation
- Each wish has a "tusk rating" for priority
- ASCII art walrus that animates
- Unconventional UI - wishes float like snowflakes
- Sound-inspired visual elements (though we can't do audio)

**App Functionality:**
A Christmas Wish Processor where users submit wishes to Bartholomew, who "evaluates" them with witty responses. The walrus character reacts to different wish types.

**Immersive UI:**
- Floating snowflakes in background
- Aurora borealis gradient
- Wishes appear as floating ice crystals
- The walrus has different expressions based on wishes
