Theme Analysis: Christmas Walrus B2B Professional App

**Character Concept:**
- Name: "Wendell the Workflow Walrus" - a distinguished, business-savvy walrus who helps teams manage their holiday productivity
- Personality: Professional yet warm, wears a Santa hat with a monocle, carries a clipboard
- Visual: SVG walrus with Santa hat, tusks, and a friendly business demeanor

**OKLCH Color Palette (Professional Christmas):**
- Deep navy background: oklch(0.15 0.03 250) - professional, sophisticated
- Rich Christmas green: oklch(0.45 0.15 145) - forest green, not too bright
- Elegant burgundy/maroon: oklch(0.35 0.12 15) - muted red, professional
- Warm gold accents: oklch(0.7 0.15 85) - for highlights and CTAs
- Crisp white/cream: oklch(0.95 0.01 90) - text and cards
- Frosted accent: oklch(0.85 0.05 220) - subtle ice blue

**Gradients:**
- Header: linear-gradient(in oklch, oklch(0.2 0.06 250), oklch(0.15 0.04 220))
- Cards: subtle gradient for depth
- Buttons: gold to amber gradient

**App Functionality:**
Since this is B2B/productivity focused with a Christmas theme, I'll create:
"Wendell's Holiday Task Tracker" - An enterprise task management tool for teams to track their end-of-year projects and holiday office tasks

**Features:**
- Task creation with priority levels
- Team member assignment
- Holiday deadline tracking
- Progress visualization
- Festive but professional UI

**Decorative Elements:**
- Subtle snowflake patterns
- Wendell the Walrus mascot as SVG
- Professional card-based layout
- Gold star ratings for priority
- Muted holiday accents (not garish)
