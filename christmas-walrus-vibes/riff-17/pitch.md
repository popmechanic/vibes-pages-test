# Pitch

A Christmas walrus with a wildcard/experimental lens - let me think unconventionally here.

**The Walrus Character:**
- Name: "Bartholomew Blubbersworth III" - a sophisticated, monocle-wearing walrus who thinks he's a Victorian gentleman but is actually a Santa's helper
- Personality: Pompous but lovable, speaks in old-timey phrases, obsessed with organizing Christmas wishes "properly"

**Wildcard Concept:**
Instead of a typical wish list, this will be a "Walrus Wish Tribunal" where Bartholomew judges whether your Christmas wishes are "worthy" based on absurd criteria. Users submit wishes, and Bartholomew provides dramatic verdicts with randomly generated pompous responses.

**OKLCH Colors - Festive but slightly off-kilter:**
- Deep teal-navy background: oklch(0.15 0.08 220) - mysterious, underwater vibes
- Rich burgundy red: oklch(0.45 0.18 15) - warm Christmas red
- Icy mint: oklch(0.85 0.12 175) - arctic, refreshing
- Warm gold: oklch(0.75 0.15 85) - festive, royal
- Snow white: oklch(0.95 0.01 250) - clean, icy

**Gradients:**
- Aurora borealis background: gradient from deep navy through teal to hints of green
- Walrus gradient: from warm gray to cool gray (realistic blubber colors)

**Visual Elements:**
- ASCII/Emoji hybrid walrus with Santa hat
- Snowflakes (❄️)
- Decorative ice crystals
- Victorian-style flourishes mixed with Christmas elements
- A "gavel" for the tribunal aesthetic

**App Functionality:**
- Submit a Christmas wish
- Bartholomew dramatically evaluates it with random pompous verdicts
- Each wish gets a "worthiness score" and elaborate Victorian-style commentary
- History of all judged wishes
- Delete wishes that were "unworthy"

**UI Feel:**
- Theatrical, like a courtroom drama
- Victorian Christmas card aesthetic meets underwater arctic theme
- Slightly absurdist humor throughout
