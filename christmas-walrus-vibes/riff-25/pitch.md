Christmas walrus theme with a "Wildcard" lens - let's go unconventional!

**Character Concept:**
Meet "Björk the Blustery" - a philosophical walrus from Iceland who became Santa's unlikely helper after a confusion at the North Pole post office. She writes existential haikus about the meaning of Christmas while wearing a crooked Santa hat.

**OKLCH Colors:**
- Deep arctic ocean blue: oklch(0.25 0.08 240) - background
- Icy turquoise: oklch(0.65 0.15 195) - accents
- Warm festive red: oklch(0.55 0.2 25) - Santa hat/highlights
- Creamy tusk white: oklch(0.95 0.02 90) - text/tusks
- Aurora green: oklch(0.6 0.18 145) - decorative
- Soft pink nose: oklch(0.7 0.12 350) - walrus details

**Gradients:**
- Arctic night sky: linear-gradient from deep blue to aurora-touched purple
- Festive shimmer: subtle red to gold transitions
