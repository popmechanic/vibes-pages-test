Christmas-themed walrus with a wildcard/experimental lens... Let me think unconventionally here.

**The Walrus Character:**
- Name: "Waldo the Whimsical Walrus" - a mystical, fortune-telling walrus who lives at the North Pole
- Personality: Eccentric, speaks in riddles, dispenses bizarre holiday wisdom
- Visual: I'll create an SVG walrus with a Santa hat, but make it surreal/glitchy

**OKLCH Colors - Going unconventional for the wildcard lens:**
- Instead of traditional red/green, I'll use unexpected Christmas colors
- Deep arctic purple: oklch(0.25 0.15 290) - mysterious night sky
- Glowing aurora teal: oklch(0.7 0.2 180) - northern lights
- Warm walrus brown: oklch(0.5 0.1 50) - the walrus himself
- Hot pink accent: oklch(0.65 0.25 350) - unexpected festive pop
- Icy blue: oklch(0.85 0.1 220) - snow and ice

**Gradients:**
- Aurora borealis background: linear-gradient from deep purple through teal to pink
- Snow effect with subtle shimmer

**App Functionality - Wildcard approach:**
- "Waldo's Wisdom Workshop" - a fortune cookie meets advent calendar meets mad libs
- Users can ask Waldo for holiday wisdom
- Waldo generates absurdist, surreal holiday fortunes
- Users can save their favorite fortunes and rate them
- The walrus animates and "speaks" the fortunes

**Immersive UI:**
- Floating snowflakes (CSS animation)
- Glitchy/aurora effects on the walrus
- Surreal typography choices
- The walrus SVG will be hand-crafted with personality
