Let me think about this Christmas walrus theme with a wildcard/experimental lens...

**OKLCH Colors for a festive but unconventional Christmas walrus:**
- Deep ocean blue-green for walrus habitat: oklch(0.25 0.08 220)
- Warm Santa red with high chroma: oklch(0.55 0.22 25)
- Icy teal for arctic vibes: oklch(0.7 0.15 195)
- Golden tinsel yellow: oklch(0.85 0.18 85)
- Snowy white with slight blue: oklch(0.95 0.02 240)
- Deep purple for magical night sky: oklch(0.2 0.12 280)

**Gradients:**
- Aurora borealis effect in the background
- Ocean-to-sky gradient for immersion

**Walrus Character Concept:**
Meet "Wadsworth P. Tuskington III" - a distinguished, monocle-wearing walrus with a Santa hat who runs a "Festive Compliment Dispensary." He's sophisticated yet absurd.

**Unconventional/Wildcard approach:**
- The walrus is rendered as an elaborate SVG with animations
- Users can "feed" the walrus fish, and he dispenses holiday compliments/fortunes
- The more fish, the more elaborate the compliments become
- Track fish fed and compliments received in Fireproof

**UI Elements:**
- Floating snowflakes
- Aurora borealis animated background
- The walrus bounces/wiggles when happy
- Fish icons for feeding
- Ornate Victorian-style text for the distinguished walrus persona
