Theme: Christmas walrus with Santa hat - but with a WILDCARD lens, so let's go unexpected and experimental!

Instead of a typical Christmas app, let's create something unconventional: A "Walrus Weather Report" where a named walrus character (Sir Blubbert McTuskington III) gives dramatic, overly theatrical weather predictions for the North Pole. The walrus will be rendered as a creative SVG with a Santa hat, and users can submit "weather sightings" that the walrus dramatically interprets.

OKLCH Colors for a wild, experimental Christmas vibe:
- Deep arctic ocean blue: oklch(0.25 0.12 250) - background
- Icy cyan glow: oklch(0.7 0.18 200) - accents
- Warm Christmas red: oklch(0.55 0.22 25) - Santa hat, buttons
- Golden sparkle: oklch(0.85 0.15 85) - highlights, stars
- Frosty white: oklch(0.95 0.02 250) - text, snow
- Aurora purple: oklch(0.5 0.2 300) - decorative aurora borealis effect

Gradients:
- Aurora sky gradient for background
- Icy to warm gradient for interactive elements

The walrus will be an SVG character with personality - big expressive eyes, magnificent mustache, Santa hat askew. Name: "Sir Blubbert McTuskington III, Royal Meteorologist of the Arctic Circle"

Functionality: 
- Users submit "weather phenomena" sightings
- The walrus dramatically interprets each one with theatrical flair
- Real-time feed of all sightings with walrus commentary
- Festive, quirky, and full of holiday absurdity

UI Elements:
- Animated aurora borealis background effect
- Floating snowflakes
- The walrus as the central character giving "reports"
- Retro/theatrical weather report aesthetic
