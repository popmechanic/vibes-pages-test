# Pitch

Theme: Christmas walrus with Santa hat - but with a "Wildcard" lens meaning unexpected and experimental.

Let me think unconventionally here:
- Instead of a cute cuddly walrus, what about a sophisticated, mysterious walrus?
- A walrus named "Barnaby Tusksworth III" - a distinguished gentleman walrus who runs a secret underground Christmas wish fulfillment operation
- The app could be his "Wish Command Center" - where he tracks and fulfills unusual Christmas wishes
- Visually: Deep, moody Christmas colors - not bright red/green but sophisticated burgundy, deep forest, and antique gold
- The walrus could be rendered as an elaborate ASCII art portrait or stylized SVG

OKLCH Colors:
- Deep burgundy/wine: oklch(0.35 0.15 15) 
- Antique gold: oklch(0.75 0.12 85)
- Deep forest green: oklch(0.25 0.08 145)
- Warm cream: oklch(0.92 0.03 85)
- Mysterious purple-black: oklch(0.15 0.05 280)

Gradients:
- Background: Deep purple-black to forest green gradient for mystery
- Cards: Burgundy to dark with gold accents

App functionality: "Barnaby's Secret Wish Registry" - users submit unusual/quirky Christmas wishes and Barnaby (the walrus) assigns them mysteriousness ratings and fulfillment status. Very unconventional wish list!

Decorative elements:
- ASCII art walrus with monocle and Santa hat
- Snowflakes with mysterious symbols
- Old-timey telegram/secret society aesthetic
